1. Common distance metrics: Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, Cosine, Hamming.
2. Real-world applications: Face recognition, image retrieval, fraud detection, medical diagnosis, document classification.
3. Distance metrics explained:
   - Euclidean: Straight-line distance.
   - Manhattan: Sum of absolute differences.
   - Minkowski: Generalization of Euclidean and Manhattan.
   - Cosine Similarity: Measures cosine of the angle between vectors.
   - Hamming: Number of differing bits.
4. Cross-validation: Helps in assessing model performance by reducing bias/variance.
5. Variance and bias in KNN:
   - Low k: Low bias, high variance.
   - High k: Higher bias, lower variance.
